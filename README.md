# Basic App: The Tip calculator.

I expanded on another simple app that just added two values from text boxes. 
I used this app to practice formating doubles to the standard 2 decimal places.
To do this in swift, do the following:
1. Multiply your value by 100 (for the 2nd place unit)
2. Round that value.
3. Divide the roudned value by 100.
4. Profit.

Example:

`(round(12.12432 * 100) / 100)`

The app returns the individual fields for sales tax, tip and total meal cost as individual labels. This was a nicer
improvement than my one label for everything.
